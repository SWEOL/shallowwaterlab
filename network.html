          <p>
            We have collaborated with Dr. Stephen Bird at Fluvial Systems Research on several projects
            related to water quality monitoring and whale detection, combining satellite data analysis
            with in&nbsp;situ measurements and modelling.

          <p>
            WSP is leading the SmartHARBOUR project, on which three PhD students from the lab are working.
            The project focuses on monitoring the St. Lawrence aquatic environment in the context of the
            Contrecoeur Port Terminal expansion, using Earth observation technologies to track changes in
            habitat, bathymetry, and water quality.
