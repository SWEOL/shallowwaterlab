        <p>
          The Shallow Water Earth Observation Laboratory, led by Dr. Anders Knudby,
          uses satellite and in&nbsp;situ observations to study shallow coastal and inland
          waters. Our work focuses on satellite-derived bathymetry, habitat mapping,
          water quality monitoring, and change detection in complex aquatic environments.

      <h2>What we do</h2>
      <p class="section-intro">
        We primarily develop, test and apply Earth Observation techniques to better map, monitor and
        understand shallow aquatic systems and support their sustainable management. We work with
        data collected from satellites, manned aircraft and drones, and do fieldwork to assess the
        quality of our products. In addition, we do a large amount of other remote sensing research,
        including on retrogressive thaw slumps, pollinator insects, lava flows, and ticks!
